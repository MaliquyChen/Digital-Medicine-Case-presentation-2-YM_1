## Step1: Preprocessing
The **dicompreprocess.m** contant following steps including
1. Image Sharpening
2. Gaussian high-pass filter
3. Iterative graph binarization
4. Marker Connected Area
5. Masking
6. Image resizing
## Step2: Train the CNN model
Three types of models can be trained respectively by **resnet18.m、resnet50.m、resnet101.m**
## Step3: Random forest
